# Welcome to bhop_world.

This is a bunnyhopping game, implementing various aspects which I like from quake and its derivatives.

[Here's a youtube video showcasing the engine which powers it.](https://youtu.be/t-kWDM4dkZM)

The 2d graphics are done in sfml and the rest is done by yours truly.

To build it simply do "make bhop_world"
